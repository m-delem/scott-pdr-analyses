# Data analysis for the Pregistered Direct Replication of Scott (2013)

This repository contains all the code and materials required to reproduce the analyses presented in the Pregistered Direct Replication (PDR) of [the article by Scott (2013) on corollary discharge]. The preprint of the PDR can be found [here](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/abps9) and the associated OSF project with all materials can be found [here](https://osf.io/4vzkh/). This repository is linked in the project.

This repository is a Quarto project endowed with a `renv` R environment to ensure the stability of the packages that were used to conduct the analysis and guarantee the reproducibility of the results. The repository is based on [this Quarto project template](https://github.com/m-delem/my-quarto-template): you can find a quick tutorial to use this project structure and an in-depth explanation of its elements there.
